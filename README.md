Welcome to the MERN CRUD Application repository! This project demonstrates how to build a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).


## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuneebProblemSolver/MERN-FRONTEND-WEEK02.git
cd MERN-FRONTEND-WEEK02
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Run the Server
```bash
npm start 
```
The backend server will start at http://localhost:3000.

### Usage:

Once the servers are running, you can access the application in your web browser. Here are the available endpoints:

```bash 
Register User: POST http://localhost:3000/user/register

Fetch Users: GET http://localhost:3000/user/details

Fetch Single User: GET http://localhost:3000/user/:id

Update User: PUT http://localhost:3000/user/edit/:id

Delete User: DELETE http://localhost:3000/user/delete/:id

Change User Status: PUT http://localhost:3000/user/status/:id

Export Users to CSV: GET http://localhost:3000/userexport
```
